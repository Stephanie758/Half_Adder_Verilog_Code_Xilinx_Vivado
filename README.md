## 🔄 Understanding the Code 

The provided Verilog code is structured in a way that's easy to understand. Here’s a quick breakdown:

- **module half_adder**: This declares the half adder module.
- **inputs A and B**: These are the binary inputs to the half adder.
- **outputs SUM and CARRY**: These provide the results of the addition.

### Example Code Snippet

```verilog
module half_adder (
    input A,
    input B,
    output SUM,
    output CARRY
);
    assign SUM = A ^ B;  // Sum is the XOR of A and B
    assign CARRY = A & B; // Carry is the AND of A and B
endmodule
```

This simple code illustrates how the half adder works.
